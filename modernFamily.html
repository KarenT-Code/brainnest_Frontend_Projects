    <h1> Modern Family </h1>
    <img src="images/ModernFamily.jfif">
    <p> Three different but related families face trials and tribulations in their own uniquely comedic ways.
        Told from the perspective of an unseen documentary filmmaker, the series offers an honest, often-hilarious perspective of family life 
    </p>
    <h2> Top 3 favorite Characters </h2>
    <ul><li><h3> Phil </h3> <img src="images/modernChar/Phil.jfif" width="300" height="200"></li>
        <p>
            Phil describes himself as a "cool dad." A devoted family man, he dotes on his wife Claire and 
            constantly tries to find ways to bond with his three kids, 
            which quite often falls short. He uses a parenting method that he calls "peerenting", 
            which is a combination of talking like a peer, but acting like a parent
        </p>
        <li><h3> Cameron </h3> <img src="images/modernChar/Cam.jfif" width="300" height="200"></li>
        <p>
            Cameron has a very big personality and a flare for theatricals. His bubbly outgoing personality contrasts to
            Mitch's uptight manner. 
            Their opposite dispositions often lead to hilarity and them being at odds with one another.
        </p>
        <li><h3> Mitchell </h3> <img src="images/modernChar/Mitch.jfif" width="300" height="200"></li>
        <p>
            Mitchell is shown to be a Type A, high-strung individual. At most times, he is the exact opposite of Cam, 
            which usually causes disagreements but their resolutions are always because they counterbalance each other.
        </p>
