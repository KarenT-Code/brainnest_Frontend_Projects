            Michael Gary Scott is the central character of the NBC sitcom The Office.
            Despite his effective sales skills, Michael is lacking in almost all other skills. 
            Jim once created a graph that shows Michaels spends 80% of his time "distracting others", 1
            9% "procrastination", and 1% "critical thinking."

        <li><h3> Dwight Schrute </h3> <img src="images/officeChar/Dwight.jfif" width="300" height="200"></li>
        <p>
            He is known for his lack of social skills and common sense, 
            but he is also known for his love of martial arts and the justice system
        </p>
        <li><h3> Jim Halpert </h3> <img src="images/officeChar/Jim.jfif" width="300" height="200"></li>
        <P>
            His character serves as the intelligent, mild-mannered straight man role to Michael, 
            although he is also notable for his rivalrous pranks on fellow salesman Dwight Schrute and 
            his romantic interest in receptionist Pam Beesly
